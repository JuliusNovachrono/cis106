# Notes Lecture 5: Command Line text editors
 
## The Basics of Nano
* Nano is a very basic and efficient text editor used to create, save, and add logs of the outputs on the terminal and create other types of files. 
* Nano is usually pre installed with most linux distributions. All one has to do is type nano into the terminal to activate text editor. Nano will activate on your current directory.
* The following are basic commands on nano:
* ![x](/imgs/FinalPics/nano.png)

## The Basics of Vim
* Vim unlike nano is not pre installed and will have to be downloaded.
  - to simply install type the following: 
  - > sudo apt install vim
* Vim unlike nano is not very basic and dull, it has many modern features integrated into the app, It can do everything nano can do and much more.
* Vim includes many features such as spell check., merging, unicode, scripting languages supported, plugins,and SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING!!
* To start vim simply type vim into the terminal. Followed by the letter "i" to enter into insert mode. 
* To enter command line on vim enter this symbol with the two little dots that I forgot what it's called --> :
* To save enter   :w
* To quit enter   :q
* To create a file enter vim followed by the name of the new file: 
* > vim hello.txt
* To open an existing file type :e followed by name of file.
* To navigate through vim file use:
* k for up
* j for down
* h for left
* l for right
* yw to copy a word
* yy to copy a line 
* x to cut
* u to undo
* As you can see vim is clearly superior in every aspect.
