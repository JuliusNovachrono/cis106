# Question 3: Moving Files and Directories
1. Make sure that you are working on your home directory. Run the following command: `wget https://robertalberto.com/public/lab4.zip && unzip lab4.zip && rm lab4.zip`
2. In your home directory, create the following directories: `lab4-imgs`, `lab4-audio`, `lab4-video`, `lab4-docs`
3. Move all the files inside the lab4 directory to their respective new directories in your home directory. 
4. Inside the  `lab4` directory, you will find a directory called `Wallpaperlab4`. Move this directory to your `Pictures` directory and rename it to `NewWallpapers`.
