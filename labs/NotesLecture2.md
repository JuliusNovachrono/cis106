# Notes Lecture 2: Installing Ubuntu

## What is Virtualization?
* There are two types of virtualization:
  - server side virtualization - uses software to provide a virtual desktop to the users / clients (service is provided from a web server)
  - client side virtualization - uses software that allows a user to use virtual machines (service is provided from the clients computer)
* The best benefit of virtualization is the ability to run multiple operating systems on one computer. 
* One can run two or more operating systems simultaneously by using the host or main operating system and turning on other virtual machines at the same time.
* A benefit to having a virtual machine is also the ability to test programs or scripts on the VM before running on your main operating system. 

## Using Virtualbox?
* Virtualbox is an open source virtualization software provided by oracle.
* It can run on any major operating system.

  - AMD or Intel or M1 processor (minimum dual core)
  - 4 gb of ram
