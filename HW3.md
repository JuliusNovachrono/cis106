# Homework 3 Finding a Linux Distributions to Solve Specific Problems.

Given the scenario, use the internet or go straight to Distrowatch to find a Linux distribution that will fit best. You need to explain your answers in at least 1 paragraph. (4 to 8 sentences). For each distribution provide the following information:
* What is it based on? (Debian, Slackware, Redhat, Arch, etc)
* URL to where it can be downloaded from.
* The Supported processor architecture (x86, x86_64, arm, etc)
  
## Scenario 1: Using a Live Linux Installation

John is fixing Mario’s laptop. He needs to prepare a live USB flash drive that he can boot Linux from so that he can access some important information. The problem is that he only has a 4GB flash drive available. Which Linux distribution would you advise John to use to prepare the live USB installation?
* To my good friend Mario I would recommend the Puppy Linux distribution. The package is very small in size, and is ideal to download into a USB drive to boot up a computer. Unlike most CD distributions like Ubuntu the Puppy distribution boots into the ram disk, which makes it lightweight and quick. Since Mario’s laptop needs to be fixed asap the instillation of puppy is completed at the blink of an eye. This distribution also comes fully featured for him to access important information. The supported processor architecture are   i686, x86_64,

## Scenario 2: Using Linux for parental control
Mario is concerned about his children using the house computer. He has an older laptop that he has not used in a while and has hired you to prepare that laptop for his children to use. Mario wants the children to use the computer mostly for educational purposes so he asks you to install educational tools in it. He is also concerned about his children using the internet so asks you if you could somehow install a web browser/search engine that has parental control or at least blocks adult content. Mario has given you $150 dollars for upgrades so that if needed you can proceed without contacting him. Which Linux distribution would install in Mario’s older laptop? 
* To my good buddy Mario I would recommend the Debian Edu Linux distribution. This distribution is ideal for his children to use for educational purposes. It comes preloaded with 75 built in education apps, and was created with education in mind unlike other distributions. With other distributions you would have to  download too many educational applications and parental control separately to make it functional for educational purposes. With Debian Edu you will only need to install a parental control software. The software is called Dans Guardian and is absolutely free. So, I will be keeping his $150 and go buy the whole block some mangu. The supported processor architecture are  i386, x86_64.

## Scenario 4: Reviving an old PC
Giorgina has an old computer that came with Windows Vista. She cannot afford to buy a new computer or update her current PC. Her computer is used for online shopping, reading emails, paying her bills, and listening to music. All her music is on an external hard drive and she normally does not keep important information on her computer. Georgina is willing to pay you to make her computer faster. You have concluded that installing Linux is the simplest and most cost-efficient way to help her. However, in such an old PC, Ubuntu 20.04 will be almost as slow as Windows 10 so you need to find another distribution that is much lighter on system resources and has been designed for running on older hardware. Which distribution will you install in Georgina’s ~~dinosaur~~ PC?
