## Questions to answer
 
1. Which project will you be completing?
- Default project

2. Why have you chosen this project?

- I chose this project because of time management. Honestly I would like to start one of the programming or web development, but I need time to complete other projects and start studying for finals.
 
3. What are the possible problems, roadblocks, or difficulties you anticipate during the process of completing the project?

- I don't think i'll run into any issues, but possible road block would probably be taking a bit longer to complete than expected.

4. How are you planning to overcome these difficulties?
   
- Trying to grind this project starting tomorrow, I'll have the free time to dedicate all my hours to this project these next few days.
  
5. How do you think completing this project will help you in your career?
   
- I think it will help me with time management, a skill I lacked in the past, but i've been getting pretty good at it. It will also help with making tutorial's or teaching. I need to improve the way I teach, because I am terrible at teaching most things.
